development:
- with the start script, webpack opens src/index.js file which is the react app (no backend here)
- default port in webpack is 8080
- to develop the react app with a working backend I added a proxy to the devserver
  in the webpack config file. Now react development starts on 3000 and I start the 
  backend on 3001 with start-prod. Thanks to the proxy set, the backend is also served 
  on port 3000

production:
- start-prod script starts the express app, which has for static folder the dist folder
  which is the folder containing the built react app
- with nodemon I can update the backend files live, and the frontend in the static folder
  doesn't matter if works or not I can test and develop the backend


1 problem left: test and develop the frontend with a backend in the background
